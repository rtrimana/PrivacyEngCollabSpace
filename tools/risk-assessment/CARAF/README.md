**Name of Tool:** CARAF (Crypto Agility Risk Assessment Framework)

**Primary Focus Area:** Post-Quantum Cryptography (PQC) Risk Assessment

**Brief Description:** Crypto Agility Risk Assessment Framework (CARAF) is a framework tailored for organizations seeking to evaluate the risk of PQC to their assets, understand where to start with migration, prioritize their assets for PQC migration, and receive technical guidance or resources to enable the PQC migration. Crypto agility refers to the ability to replace existing crypto primitives, algorithms, or protocols quickly, inexpensively, and with minimal risk of exposure and business overhead. Transitioning from one crypto solution to another can be time-consuming and expose organizations to unnecessary security risks. Therefore, CARAF can help organizations perform risk-based assessment and determine appropriate mitigation strategies tailored to their risk tolerance.
